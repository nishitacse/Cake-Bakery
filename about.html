   <h2>BAKERS DELIGHT</h2>
<p>Bakers Delight is a perfect example of “we do what we love”. Third consecutive generation 
    in same profession shows our heart connection with bakery. We love baking and our products
     are not simply prepared with ingredients, these are rather enriched with deep care and
      love that we pay at each step. Company started first outlet in August 2014 in Meerut Uttar Pradesh
       and within short span of time it is a tale of the town. With our qualified and talented 
       team of chefs we focus on all aspects of food service right from product safety to quality 
       just to make sure that our family of customers makes their events “a sweet memory” with us.<br>
       <br>
    
    With a decent start as a cake shop, Bakers Delight worked in different segments of bakery to introduce
     modern and traditional products simultaneously. One can have yummiest cheese cakes to traditional 
     Nan Khatai cookies all in same place. This combination of tradition and innovation is Bakers Delight
     recognition.</p>
